I changed some of the css color values because the value on figma and the one on the browser looked different. I also changed some of the font sizes since I dont have all the fonts available.

The space on the header and the space on the footer is different between each item so I changed it to make it more consistent.

* Changed the font style on the footer to make it more consistent with the header
* Changed border color on the form
* Added a border to the header on the mobile version
* Darkened background image by 10% mobile screen to improve readability
* Compressed the background image
* Added toggle password functionality
